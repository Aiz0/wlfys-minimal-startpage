You can use the single-page-version as is with Firefox (recent updates broke extension's access to local files, but you can upload one and only one file to New Tab Override's servers). I don't know about Chrome, check r/startpage's wiki. I'm no web developer so it's kind of badly written sorry; don't hesitate to fork or dm me and correct stuff (link to my twitter on the bottom of the page). I know it doesn't look very good when the window is small.

This startpage was inspired by [RamenMaestro's](https://github.com/RamenMaestro/startpage).
The art is by [NurAlifSidoel](https://www.deviantart.com/nuralifsidoel/art/Futaba-Rio-Seishun-Buta-Yarou-Vector-778405449).
