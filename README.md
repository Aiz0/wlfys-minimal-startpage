# wlfy's minimal startpage
This is a simple, minimal startpage I made to match my desktop's overall theme.

A live demo is available [here](https://wolfiy.gitlab.io/wlfys-minimal-startpage/).

## Use
You can use the single page version as is with FireFox using the NewTab Override extension (it lets you upload one file to their servers, but only one). I do not use Chrome, so check r/startpages'wiki for more information.

I'm not a web developer, I only learned the basics of HTML and CSS in high school and I haven't used them for a while. Don't hesitate to fork and modify to your liking. The scaling issues that were happening should be mostly fixed now (see the above pictures).

If you find any bugs and/or have suggestions to improve the page (for instance better scaling, etc.), you can DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wolfiiy) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Wolfiy/).

Thanks for checking this out :)

## Credits
I was inspired by [RamenMaestro's startpage](https://github.com/RamenMaestro/startpage).

I use [this](https://github.com/evanswa0606/firefox-simpletheme) CSS by evanswa0606 for my browser (Firefox). You might need to tweak it a little as it is optimized for macOS. On my setup, I also changed the colors to match my DE's theme.
